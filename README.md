# Shopping List

This is an updated version of my original shopping list app, refactored to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)'s serverless API routes, and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

It uses the excellent [Vercel SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) for data fetching.

# Install

`yarn`

# Config

Add a `.env.local` file with a `DB_URI` value for a MongoDB connection string.

# Dev

`yarn dev`
